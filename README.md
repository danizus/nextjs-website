## NEXT JS BASICS

*Client-Side (CS):* Runs on the client (browser), with dynamic updates using JavaScript.Client-side rendering (CSR) can pose challenges for SEO
*Server-Side (SS):* Runs on the server, delivering fully rendered HTML to the client.With SSR, the server sends fully rendered HTML to the client, making it easier for search engine crawlers to interpret and index the content.

- your component should be a client side component if youre using hooks or any userinteraction

## Hydration

It’s like giving someone a beautifully wrapped gift, and when they open it, the contents are different from what they expected. In the world of coding, it means the content on the server doesn’t quite match what’s on the visitor’s screen. Mismatches between server-generated content and client-rendered content can lead to unexpected issues within your Next.js application.

## Unpacking the Causes
1. Dynamic Data and State Updates:
Hydration errors often arise when your application involves dynamic data. If the data displayed during server-side rendering (SSR) is different from the data rendered on the client, it can lead to inconsistencies.

2. Improper HTML Structure:
Incorrect HTML structure can also contribute to hydration errors. For instance, nesting a <div> tag within a <p> tag violates proper HTML semantics and can trigger hydration errors.

3. Asynchronous Content Loading:
If your application loads data asynchronously on the client side and the timing of data fetching differs between SSR and client-side rendering (CSR), it can lead to hydration mismatches.

4. Third-Party Libraries and Components:
Using third-party libraries or custom components that don’t handle SSR and hydration correctly can introduce inconsistencies in your application’s content.


## Solving hydration Errors
1. Utilize the useEffect Hook:
One effective solution to hydration errors involves using the useEffect hook. By employing this hook, you can ensure that data fetched on the client side matches what was rendered on the server. For example, you can fetch and update dynamic data within the useEffect callback, synchronizing the content.

Imagine you’re building a weather app using Next.js. You want to make sure that the weather information is consistent between when the app first loads and when the user interacts with it.
